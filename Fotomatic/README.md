Hi ðŸ‘‹

This was  HTML and CSS project sompleted during the Front End Developer Course.

This project was to fix a site, taking the existing HTML and CSS and redoing the page so that it matched the visuals and was responsive. 

This project focused on the use of flex blocks in particular to create responsive web design as grid design had not yet been covered.
