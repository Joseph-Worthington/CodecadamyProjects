                    <td>
                        Select by #id
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        #firstname
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        #id is the most specifc selector as only one element will have that specific #id. Only the element with the specific #id of id="firstname" will be affected by this selector. It will overwrite any existing CSS from other selectors such as .class or element as they are lower in the selector heirarchy.
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        Select by .class
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        .intro
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        .class ranks second in the select heirarchy, it is more specific than an element but can be overwritten by the #id. .class is a great way to style multiple elements at a time, as the selector can be added to multiple items, allowing you to reuse the same styling any elements you add the class="intro" too.
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        Select by Element
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        p
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        element is the lowest selector in the heirarchy, using it will affect any element with that tag but the CSS from an element selector can easly be overwritten using a .class or #id selector as they are more specific. It is easy way to add unversal styles to tags, any <code><p></code> element will be effected by this selector
                    </td>

                    <td>
                        All selectors can be used together to create more specific slectors, to target single areas or specific elements of a page
                    </td>
                    <td colspan="2">
                        p .class will target every p element with a specific class. #id .class will target only the elements that have both the specifi #id pluss the extra class.
